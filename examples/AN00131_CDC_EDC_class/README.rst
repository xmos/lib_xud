USB CDC-ECM Class for Ethernet over USB
=======================================

Summary
-------

This application note shows how to create a USB device compliant to
the standard USB Communications Device Class (CDC) and the Ethernet Control Model (ECM)
Subclass on an XMOS multicore microcontroller.

The code associated with this application note provides an example of
using the XMOS USB Device Library (XUD) and associated USB class descriptors
to provide a framework for the creation of a USB device emulating Ethernet.

This example USB CDC-ECM implementation provides an emulated Ethernet interface
running over high speed USB. It supports the standard requests associated with ECM model
of the USB CDC specification. 

The demo application handles the Ethernet frames received from the USB endpoitns and hosts a
HTTP web server acting as another virtual network device. A standard web browser from host PC 
can open the web page served from the USB device. The web page provides a statistics of
different packets like ICMP, TCP, UDP etc received through the Ethernet frames from the host PC.
This demonstrates a simple way in which Ethernet over USB applications can easily be deployed 
using an xCORE-USB device.

The demo application code can be extended to bridge an actual Ethernet interface by adding MAC 
and MII software layers. This enables you to create USB to Ethernet Adaptors using xCORE-USB 
device.

Note: This application note provides a standard USB CDC-ECM class device and as a 
result does not require external drivers to run on Linux and Mac. Windows doesn't support
USB ECM model natively and thus requires third party drivers.

Required tools and libraries
............................

* xTIMEcomposer Tools - Version 14.0.0
* XMOS USB library - Version 3.1.0

Required hardware
.................

This application note is designed to run on an XMOS xCORE-USB series device.

The example code provided with the application has been implemented and tested
on the xCORE-USB sliceKIT (XK-SK-U16-ST) but there is no dependancy on this board
and it can be modified to run on any development board which uses an xCORE-USB series device.

Prerequisites

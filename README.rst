XMOS USB Device (XUD) Library
=============================

Overview
........

lib_xud merges the existing sc_xud and lib_usb (a fork of sc_xud) and replaces them both. It includes an API that supports both previous libraries providing a unified and maintained library going forward.

The XMOS USB Device (XUD) library provides a low-level interface to USB.  lib_xud is a software defined, industry-standard, USB library
that allows you to control an USB bus via xCORE ports.

The library provides functionality to act as a USB *device* only.

This library is for use with xCORE-200 Series or xCORE-AI series devices only, previous generations of xCORE devices are no longer supported.

Features
........

 * USB 2.0 Full-speed (12Mbps) and High-speed (480Mbps)

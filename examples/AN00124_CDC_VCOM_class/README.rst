USB CDC Class as Virtual Serial Port
====================================

Summary
-------

This application note shows how to create a USB device compliant to
the standard USB Communications Device Class (CDC) on an XMOS multicore microcontroller.

The code associated with this application note provides an example of
using the XMOS USB Device Library (XUD) and associated USB class descriptors
to provide a framework for the creation of a USB CDC device that implements
Abstract Control Model (ACM).

This example USB CDC ACM implementation provides a Virtual Serial port
running over high speed USB. The Virtual Serial port supports the 
standard requests associated with ACM model of the class.

A serial terminal program from host PC connects to virtual serial port and 
interacts with the application. This basic application demo implements a loopback 
of characters from the terminal to the XMOS device and back to the terminal.
This application demo code demonstrates a simple way in which USB CDC class 
devices can easily be deployed using an xCORE-USB device.

Note: This application note provides a standard USB CDC class device and as a 
result does not require external drivers to run on Windows, Mac or Linux.

Required tools and libraries
............................

* xTIMEcomposer Tools - Version 14.0.0
* XMOS USB library - Version 3.1.0

Required hardware
.................

This application note is designed to run on an XMOS xCORE-USB series device.

The example code provided with the application has been implemented and tested
on the xCORE-USB sliceKIT (XK-SK-U16-ST) but there is no dependancy on this board 
and it can be modified to run on any development board which uses an xCORE-USB series device.

Prerequisites
.............

  - This document assumes familiarity with the XMOS xCORE architecture, the Universal Serial Bus 2.0 Specification and related specifications, the XMOS tool chain and the xC language. Documentation related to these aspects which are not specific to this application note are linked to in the references appendix.

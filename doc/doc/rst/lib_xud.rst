Introduction
************

This document details the `XMOS` USB Device (XUD) Library.  This library enables the development of
USB 2.0 devices (only) on the `XMOS xcore` architecture.

This document describes the structure of the library, its basic use and resources required.

This document assumes familiarity with the `xmos xcore` architecture, the Universal Serial Bus 2.0
Specification (and related specifications), the `XMOS` XTC tool chain and XC language.

This library is for use with `xcore-200` (XS2 architecture) series or `xcore.ai` (XS3 architecture)
series devices only, previous generations of `xcore` devices (i.e. XS1 architecture) are not
supported.

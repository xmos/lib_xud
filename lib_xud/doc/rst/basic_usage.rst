Basic Usage
===========


Basic use is termed to mean each endpoint runs in its own dedicated core.
Multiple endpoints in a single core are possible, please see Advanced Usage.

XUD Core: ``XUD_Main()``
---------------------------

This is the main XUD task that interfaces with the USB transceiver.
It performs power-signalling/handshaking on the USB bus, and passes packets
to/from the various endpoints.

This function should be called directly from the top-level ``par``
statement in ``main()`` to ensure that the XUD library is ready
within the 100ms allowed by the USB specification.

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_Main

Endpoint Type Table
...................

The endpoint type table should take an array of ``XUD_EpType`` to inform XUD
about endpoints being used.  This is mainly used to indicate the transfer-type
of each endpoint (bulk, control, isochronous or interrupt) as well as
whether the endpoint wishes to be informed about bus-resets (see `Status Reporting`_).

*Note:* endpoints can also be marked as disabled.

Endpoints that are not used will ``NAK`` any traffic from the host.

``PwrConfig``
.............

The ``PwrConfig`` parameter to ``XUD_Main()`` indicates if the device is bus or self-powered.

Valid values for this parameter are ``XUD_PWR_SELF`` and ``XUD_PWR_BUS``.

When ``XUD_PWR_SELF`` is used, ``XUD_Main()`` monitors the VBUS input for a valid voltage and reponds appropriately. The USB Specification states that the devices pull-ups must be disabled when a valid VBUS is not present. This is important when submitting a device for compliance testing since this is explicitly tested.

If the device is bus-powered ``XUD_PWR_BUS`` can be used since is assumed that the device is not powered up when VBUS is not present and therefore no voltage monitoring is required.  In this configuration the VBUS input to the device/PHY need not be present.

``XUD_PWR_BUS`` can be used in order to run on a self-powered board without provision for VBUS wiring to the PHY/device, but this is not advised.

Endpoint Communication with ``XUD_Main()``
---------------------------------------------

Communication state between a core and the XUD library is encapsulated
in an opaque type:

.. doxygentypedef:: XUD_ep

All client calls communicating with the XUD library pass in this type.
These data structures can be created at the start of execution of a
client core with the following call that takes as an argument the
endpoint channel connected to the XUD library:

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_InitEp

Endpoint data is sent/received using three main functions,
``XUD_SetData()``, ``XUD_GetData()`` and ``XUD_GetSetupData()``.

These assembly functions implement the low-level shared memory/channel
communication with the ``XUD_Main()`` core. For developer convenience
these calls are wrapped up by XC functions.

These functions will automatically deal with any low-level complications required
such as Packet ID toggling etc.

``XUD_GetBuffer()``
...................

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_GetBuffer

``XUD_SetBuffer()``
...................

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_SetBuffer


``XUD_SetBuffer_EpMax()``
.........................

This function provides a similar function to ``XUD_SetBuffer`` function
but it breaks the data up in packets of a fixed
maximum size. This is especially useful for control transfers where large
descriptors must be sent in typically 64 byte transactions.

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_SetBuffer_EpMax

.. _xud_status_reporting:

Status Reporting
................

Status reporting on an endpoint can be enabled so that bus state is
known. This is achieved by ORing ``XUD_STATUS_ENABLE`` into the relevant
endpoint in the endpoint type table.

This means that endpoints are notified of USB bus resets (and
bus-speed changes). The XUD access functions discussed previously
(``XUD_GetData``, ``XUD_SetData``, etc.) return XUD_RES_RST if
a USB bus reset is detected.

This reset notification is important if an endpoint core is expecting
alternating INs and OUTs. For example, consider the case where an
endpoint is always expecting the sequence OUT, IN, OUT (such as a control
transfer). If an unplug/reset event was received after the first OUT,
the host would return to sending the initial OUT after a replug, while
the endpoint would hang on the IN. The endpoint needs to know of the bus
reset in order to reset its state machine.

*Endpoint 0 therefore requires this functionality since it deals with
bi-directional control transfers.*

This is also important for high-speed devices, since it is not
guaranteed that the host will detect the device as a high-speed device.
The device therefore needs to know what bus-speed it is currently running at.

After a reset notification has been received, the endpoint must call the
``XUD_ResetEndpoint()`` function. This will return the current bus
speed.

``XUD_ResetEndpoint()``
.......................

.. doxygenfunction:: XUD_ResetEndpoint


SOF Channel
-----------

An application can pass a channel-end to the ``c_sof`` parameter of
``XUD_Main()``.  This will cause a word of data to be output every time
the device receives a SOF from the host.  This can be used for timing
information for audio devices etc.  If this functionality is not required
``null`` should be passed as the parameter.  Please note, if a channel-end
is passed into ``XUD_Main()`` there must be a responsive task ready to
receive SOF notifications otherwise the ``XUD_Main()`` task will be
blocked attempting to send these messages.

.. _xud_usb_test_modes:

USB Test Modes
--------------

XUD supports the required test modes for USB Compliance testing.

XUD accepts commands from the endpoint 0 channels (in or out) to signal which test mode
to enter via the ``XUD_SetTestMode()`` function. The commands are based on the definitions
of the Test Mode Selector Codes in the USB 2.0 Specification Table 11-24.  The supported test modes are
summarised in :ref:`table_test_modes`.

.. _table_test_modes:

.. table:: Supported Test Mode Selector Codes
    :class: horizontal-borders vertical_borders

    +--------+-------------------------------------+
    | Value  | Test Mode Description               |
    +========+=====================================+
    | 1      | Test_J                              |
    +--------+-------------------------------------+
    | 2      | Test_K                              |
    +--------+-------------------------------------+
    | 3      | Test_SE0_NAK                        |
    +--------+-------------------------------------+
    | 4      | Test_Packet                         |
    +--------+-------------------------------------+

The passing other codes endpoints other than 0 to ``XUD_SetTestMode()`` could result in undefined
behaviour.

As per the USB 2.0 Specification a power cycle or reboot is required to exit the test mode.
